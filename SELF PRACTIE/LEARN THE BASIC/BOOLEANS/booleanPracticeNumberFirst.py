# Most Values are True
# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
# Any string is True, except empty strings.
# Any number is True, except 0.
# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.

# Some Values are False
# In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.
# Example
# The following will return False:
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})
